# Overview

This section of the project documentation focuses on the available **datasets** used within the KielMAT toolbox. These datasets are essential for testing and validating the functionality of the toolboxâ€™s modules. Below is an introduction to the available datasets, with links to further details and data access.


## [Keep Control](keepcontrol.md)

The **Keep Control** dataset is derived from the [Keep Control](https://www.keep-control.eu/) project, which is part of an Industrial Academic Initial Training Network. This dataset includes full-body mobility data collected from both healthy and neurological cohorts, and is primarily used to validate inertial measurement unit (IMU) algorithms.

## [Mobilise-D](mobilised.md)

The **Mobilise-D** dataset is derived from the [Mobilise-D](https://mobilise-d.eu/) consortium, a European project aimed at developing a comprehensive system for monitoring and evaluating people's gait using digital technologies. The dataset includes data collected using sensors worn on the body, such as a low back-worn inertial measurement unit (IMU). The dataset provides valuable insights into real-world gait analysis using wearable sensors and has been used to validate gait measurement methodologies.
